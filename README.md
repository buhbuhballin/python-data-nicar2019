*Coach:* Lam Thuy Vo, BuzzFeed News

*Description:* Learning a programming language is much like learning to write a news story. There are certain styles and conventions to follow, a standard order, etc. In this session geared toward absolute beginners, we’ll get started with some of the basics of this new language. This session is good for: People who are comfortable working with data in spreadsheets or database managers and want to make the leap to programming.

*Description:* Imagine rolling Excel and MySQL into one tool that also allows you to track your code and share it. That’s the pandas Python library in a nutshell. There’s a lot more you can do with it, of course, but this will be a good start. We’ll learn how to slice and dice our data and extract basic stats. Specifically, we’ll cover loading the data, filtering, sorting, joining and grouping data. This class is good for: People who are comfortable with Excel and are familiar with the basics of SQL and Python.

### Python 3: Data cleaning and visualization

Description: Now that you’ve got a handle on pandas, it’s time to jump into some advanced topics. You know how to import a dataset, but what happens when you load the data and nothing looks right? We’ll walk through cleaning up a dirty dataset with pandas. Then we’ll jump into the fun part: visualizing the data you’ve analyzed with a Python library called matplotlib. This session is good for: People who can load and perform basic summary and grouping functions in pandas.
