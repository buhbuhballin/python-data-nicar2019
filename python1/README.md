## Resources, etc.

Some general concepts:
* #document your code
* Google is your friend when you get those error messages
* [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) can be super helpful too
* Expect to make mistakes - typing correctly 100% is impossible and many errors are misspelled words, missing commas, wrong indentation
* Join [Python Journos] (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pythonjournos) email list
* Search github 
* Ask for help on the News Nerdery slack channel
* Check out [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/). It has great tutorials and recommendations.
* Practice. Try [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) or the Py app for your phone.
* Work on a project. Start with something simple, like a program to download and open a file.
* Ben Welsh has [great Django](http://first-django-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [data journalism](http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/) tutorials online.
* Find a local meetup group that studies Python.
